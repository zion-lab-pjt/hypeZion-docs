# Buy Leveraged HYPE Tokens (bullHYPE)

Leveraged HYPE Token (bullHYPE) is a token that provides structural leveraged exposure to HYPE.

Unlike traditional perpetual futures (Perps) or margin trading, there is no liquidation risk or funding costs. With a single on-chain mint or swap, users can establish a leveraged position suitable for long-term holding.

Leveraged HYPE Token (bullHYPE) is designed as an extension layer of Hypezion Finance's Structural Stability Model. Internally, it achieves perpetual on-chain leverage through a "Tokenized Leverage Architecture" that combines collateral assets (kHYPE), stablecoin (hzUSD), and adjustment coefficients.

### 2. Background and Design Philosophy

#### 2.1 Motivation — Why Structural Leverage?

Traditional leverage methods (CEX Perps / DeFi Vaults) have consistently faced the following challenges:

| Issue                | Traditional Leverage            | bullHYPE (Hypezion Finance) |
| -------------------- | ------------------------------- | --------------------------- |
| Funding Costs        | Continuous fees required        | None                        |
| Liquidation Risk     | Forced closure on price decline | No liquidations             |
| Position Maintenance | Active management needed        | Passive holding             |
| Time-based Costs     | Accumulate over time            | Zero                        |

Hypezion Finance's Leveraged HYPE Token (bullHYPE) structurally internalizes and resolves these issues, enabling "perpetual leverage" without time-based costs.

### 3. Mechanics

#### 3.1 Basic Structure

Hypezion Finance issues two tokens: hzUSD, the flagship stablecoin, and bullHYPE, a tokenized leveraged long position on HYPE.

Both hzUSD and bullHYPE are backed by a collateral pool consisting of HYPE and its LSTs. At any point in time, the combined market capitalization of the two tokens equals the total dollar value locked in the pool. This property can be expressed with the following equation:

$$
\text{Collateral TVL} = \text{hzUSD Supply} \times \text{hzUSD Price} + \text{bullHYPE Supply} \times \text{bullHYPE Price}
$$

What makes Hypezion Finance unique is the symbiotic relationship between bullHYPE and hzUSD. bullHYPE absorbs HYPE price volatility, enabling hzUSD to maintain a 1:1 peg with the US dollar even under market volatility. Simultaneously, the surplus value generated by the protocol's LST reserves delivers substantial benefits to bullHYPE holders.

#### 3.2 No Liquidation Design

Leveraged HYPE Token (bullHYPE) holders do not directly hold a borrowing position. Therefore, liquidations do not occur even during price declines.

Internally, the system redistributes the collateral basket (kHYPE, hzUSD) across the entire protocol, maintaining positions even under extreme volatility.

> Hypezion Finance's collateral design eliminates liquidation risk through risk "sharing." It operates based on pool-wide equilibrium control rather than individual account LTV control.

#### 3.3 Price Calculation Model (Simplified)

$$
\text{Price}_{bullHYPE} = \text{NAV}_{HYPE} \times \text{LeverageFactor} \times \text{Adjustment}
$$

* **NAV(HYPE):** Net asset value of the base asset
* **LeverageFactor:** Structural volatility multiplier
* **Adjustment:** System stabilization adjustment term (internal risk coefficient)

Adjustment is fine-tuned in real-time based on pool composition, fees, and arbitrage balances.

This design prevents extreme price deviation even when market liquidity declines.

### 7. Frequently Asked Questions (FAQ)

**Q1. What is the leverage ratio of Leveraged HYPE Token (bullHYPE)?**

A. It is dynamically set by the protocol. The ratio is automatically adjusted based on market volatility and Hypezion Finance's collateral liquidity.

**Q2. Are there really no funding costs?**

A. Yes. Leveraged HYPE Token (bullHYPE) does not hold a borrowing position by structural design. Unlike traditional Perps or Vaults, there are no "position maintenance costs."

**Q3. Are there liquidations?**

A. No. Traditional liquidations apply to individual positions, but Leveraged HYPE Token (bullHYPE) is maintained through pool-wide balance control, so positions are never forcibly closed during price declines.

**Q4. Where can I check the price of Leveraged HYPE Token (bullHYPE)?**

A. It can be checked in Leverage > Market Overview within Hypezion Finance.

**Q5. Is it safe to hold long-term?**

A. Yes. Long-term holding is possible as funding and rolling are not required. However, note that losses amplify if HYPE price declines over an extended period. Due to leverage, even if HYPE price returns to the initial investment level after a decline, bullHYPE price may not return to the same level as HYPE.

### 8. Design Rationale

Leveraged HYPE Token (bullHYPE) is designed to achieve "leverage structure without the frictions of time."

Traditional DeFi leveraged positions had structures where time passage itself became a cost, including funding costs, liquidation risks, and gas-consuming rebalancing.

Hypezion Finance fundamentally resolved this through "collateral structure design."

By eliminating time-based costs, it realizes a new financial form where leverage can be held structurally.

> Leveraged HYPE Token (bullHYPE) is not merely a speculative token but embodies a new concept: "Structural Exposure."
